# Database Model Documentation Requirements

This rule provides specific guidance for documenting database models in the WhatsApp Business Assistant. Models require special attention as they define the core data structures of the system.

## Example Model Files

For reference, see these well-documented model files:
- [Order.ts](mdc:src/db/models/Order.ts)
- [Message.ts](mdc:src/db/models/Message.ts)
- [Issue.ts](mdc:src/db/models/Issue.ts)

## Required Sections for Models

All model files must include these sections:

1. **File Header**: Standard header as defined in [documentation-standards.mdc](mdc:documentation-standards.mdc)

2. **Interface Documentation**: 
   - Must document each field with its purpose
   - Must explain relationships to other models
   - Must note any default values or constraints

3. **Schema Documentation**:
   - Must explain validation rules in detail
   - Must document the purpose of any indexes
   - Must include production considerations

4. **Schema Field Comments**:
   - Each field or field group in the schema should have inline comments
   - Comments should explain business logic, not just technical details

5. **Middleware Documentation** (if applicable):
   - Document any pre/post hooks and their purposes
   - Explain validation logic
   - Note any side effects of middleware functions

## Data Relationships

When models reference other models, document:

1. **Relationship Type**: One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many
2. **Foreign Key Reference**: Which field references which other model
3. **Cascade Behavior**: What happens when related records are deleted
4. **Indexing Strategy**: How the relationship is optimized for queries

## Schema Best Practices

When documenting schemas, adhere to these best practices:

1. **Group Related Fields**: Use comments to visually group related fields
2. **Document Enums**: List all valid values for enum fields with their meanings
3. **Explain Defaults**: Document why default values were chosen
4. **Note Sensitive Fields**: Highlight fields containing sensitive/PII data
