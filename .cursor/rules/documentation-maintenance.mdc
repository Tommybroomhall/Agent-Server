# Documentation Maintenance Procedures

This rule defines when and how documentation should be updated as the codebase evolves.

## When Documentation Must Be Updated

Documentation must be updated in the following scenarios:

1. **New Files**: All new files must include complete documentation following the standards in [documentation-standards.mdc](mdc:documentation-standards.mdc).

2. **Modified Functions**: When a function's behavior, parameters, or return values change, its documentation must be updated to reflect the changes.

3. **Interface Changes**: When fields are added, removed, or modified in an interface or schema, the documentation must be updated accordingly.

4. **New Dependencies**: When a file creates new connections to other components, the CONNECTIONS section must be updated.

5. **Behavior Changes**: When a component's behavior changes in production, the PRODUCTION BEHAVIOR section must be updated.

6. **Database Impact Changes**: When database interactions change, the DATABASE IMPACT section must be updated.

## Review Checklist

Before submitting any code changes, verify that:

1. All new files have complete documentation
2. Documentation has been updated for modified components
3. All documented connections accurately reflect the current code
4. Sections are clearly labeled and formatted consistently
5. Security and compliance notes are current and complete (if applicable)

## Breadcrumb Maintenance

"Breadcrumbs" are the structured documentation elements that help developers and AI assistants navigate the code. To maintain effective breadcrumbs:

1. **Be Explicit**: All connections between components must be explicitly documented
2. **Update Cross-References**: When changing a component name or location, update all references to it in other files
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Use the exact same naming conventions across all documentation
4. **Preserve Section Structure**: Keep the established section headers and formatting
