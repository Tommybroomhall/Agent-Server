/**
 * FILE: src/agents/customerAgent.ts
 * ================================
 * CUSTOMER AGENT
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * Implementation of the Customer Agent functionality, one of the three key agent types.
 * The Customer Agent handles all interactions with end customers, including:
 * - Answering questions about orders and products
 * - Providing order status information
 * - Logging and escalating customer issues
 * - Delivering general help and information
 * 
 * CONNECTIONS:
 * - Called by agentOrchestrator.ts when customer messages are received
 * - Uses database models (User, Order, Message, Log) for data persistence
 * - Indirectly triggered by WhatsApp webhooks for customer messages
 * - Should integrate with LLM for natural language understanding (future implementation)
 * 
 * PRODUCTION BEHAVIOR:
 * 1. Receives natural language messages from customers via WhatsApp
 * 2. Interprets customer intent through message analysis
 * 3. Retrieves relevant data from database (orders, products, etc.)
 * 4. Constructs appropriate responses based on the customer's needs
 * 5. Logs all interactions for tracking and improvement
 * 6. Triggers appropriate follow-up actions (emails, notifications, etc.)
 * 
 * LIMITATIONS:
 * - Current implementation uses simplified message pattern matching
 * - In production, should use proper NLP/LLM integration for intent recognition
 * - Does not yet handle complex queries or multi-turn conversations
 * - Placeholder implementations for database lookups

 * 3. Returns structured response for delivery to the customer
